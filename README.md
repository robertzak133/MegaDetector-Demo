# MegaDetector Demo App
The MD-Demo App is a simple demonstration of the MegaDector-V6c model operating on an iPhone. It displays a live "camera" feed on the iPhone screen. The MegaDetector model runs on every frame. It draws a shaded box around any animals, people, or vehicles detected, and displays this box on the screen superimposed over the video preview. The shaded box includes a central region, which could be used for future autofocus feature, as well as text fields which identify the object class ("animal", "person", "vehicle") as well as the time taken for each object detection in milliseconds.
